# Supervised Learning
 Food Classification through the application of CNNs in both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. \
 Please consider that in this project we had to follow some rules: the CNN had to be a custom model with a total number of parameters < 1M.
 
## Methodology
- Data inspection
- Data pre-processing:
	- Training, validation and test data
	- Resize
	- Normalization
- Supervised Learning:
	- Custom CNN
	- Investigation of the results
	- Outliers inspection 
- Self-Supervised Learning:
	- Pretext task: JIGSAW PUZZLE
- Comparison of the results
